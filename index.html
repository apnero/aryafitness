This helps you commit to a routine that will help you progress with more ease, and guess what – it saves you money too! Drop ins will cost you a few extra dollars. It also helps us to offer a bigger variety of classes as class spots fill up. Speaking of spots, we maintain limited class sizes to assure each student is getting proper instruction and pre-registration guarantees a spot. If you do decide to drop in, you will be asked to sign in and pay before class. You will also need to have signed a waiver to participate.</p>

Some intermediate and advanced classes have specific prerequisites (i.e. other classes that we offer, shown mastery of a set of skills, or studio owner’s and instructor’s approval) that are in place to assure everyone’s safety. Check out our class description for prerequisites and details or ask Daniela or Allison if unsure if a certain class is right for you.</p>

                        <p>If you are taking an aerial hoop or hammock class you will want to wear fitted pants that go to your mid-calf or longer, as your knees will be wrapping around the apparatuses. Wear a shirt that can be tucked in or is fitted for upside down moves. Leotards and dance tights will also work. Everyone will be barefoot, dance shoes or socks are allowed as well. We also ask that you don’t wear anything that has buttons, buckles, snaps, grommets, zippers, studs, or anything that can snag our equipment, this includes jewelry (rings, large or dangly body jewelry ,etc.). Long hair should be tied up to avoid being tangled in the equipment. Do NOT wear any kind of lotion, cream, or oil of any sort on any part of your body the day of or the night before class. Chemicals and oils in these lotions damage and ruin the equipment and cause it to be unsafe to use. Please cover all cuts, scrapes or any open wounds with a band-aid and with athletic tape before class time to prevent the wound from reopening and getting blood on any equipment. Athletic tape is required as a band-aid will come right off after a few minutes of climbing on the equipment. We ask this for your own safety and that of our equipment.  Thank you for respecting this.</p>

                        <p>If you, or another student are injured in class, please let an instructor know immediately.</p>
                        <p>Be sure to respect your body. If you are having a day when you feel off, let your instructor know and stay close to the ground. Instructors will request this of you if they feel you are not in an aerial frame of mind that day (including such things as sleep deprivation, not having eaten enough, illness, etc.). It’s nothing personal, we all have off days when we should not be in the air.</p>

Please use good sense, but also know that if an instructor suspects that anyone is impaired, the instructor will prevent that person from participating, practicing, using equipment, and may ask them to leave the studio.</p>
